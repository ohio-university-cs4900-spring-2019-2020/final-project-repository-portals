Author: Sean Jones

## Project Description

Controls:

'WASD' moves the player around and the camera with it if it's attatched.
'LftCrtl' lowes the player and 'Space' raises the player.
'Arrowkeys' can be used to move the camera around if in free camera mode.
'1' puts the camera into first person mode on the player.
'3' puts the camera into third person mode following the player.
'l' unlocks the camera from first and third person mode allowing it to move around freely.
't' starts the mini-game of dodging the asteroids.

Summary:

There is a small demo area of the portals where the player can go through 2 corresponding portals and come out one of the
other portals. There are 4 objects placed around the portals so the player can see what direction their portal leads to better.
The player themselves is an apple that spawns in first person mode and has the ability to go third person mode or free cam.
The player can also press 't' to teleport themselves to a mini-game where the most dodge asteroids as they go down a hallway
until they reach the end where they may take a portal out.
